The cable system on the final assembly of the product was a complete mess and therefore we decided to create a container for most cables and components so that it would not be simply hanging, However this proved to be inefficient as the laser did not have enough power to cut precisely 5mm wood required for the assembly, after realising this it was decided to 3d print the container, however this also proved to be inefficient as the print required 0.5kg of filament which would be far too expensive in order to fit inside the budget.
